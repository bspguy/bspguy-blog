## My new place on the web

Hey, I created a static blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## What this is all about

**BSPGuy** is a nickname that became associated with me during my experiences in board bring-ups and firmware development. 
Although the main emphasis will undoubtedly center around all things concerning Board Support Packages (BSP), the content may also explore various domains of software and hardware that capture my interest.
